                    I am currently in the 4th and final year of my MSci in Computer Science at the University of Exeter and plan
                    on continuing my studies in 2022 with a PhD, hopefully in France. Throughout my time at university, I have gained
                    experience in many different fields within Computer Science, such as software development, artificial intelligence
                    and machine learning, but I’m mainly interested in urban informatics and its applications within environmental science.
                    </p><p class="content-txt">
                    I decided I wanted to research more into the topic when I had the opportunity to research the analysis of spatial data with a literature
                    review surrounding the concentration of crime in cities, where I learned a great deal about data analysis methods.
                    As I became even more interested in urban science, I then chose to create an urban digital twin for my 3rd-year
                    dissertation, with a focus on traffic and emissions simulations. The project had the main goal of showing how
                    digital twins and data visualisation can be incredibly useful in conveying complex and data-rich problems, such
                    as climate change, and did well towards this goal. The project and the final report can be found on
                    <a href="https://github.com/stebey/mdt_project"><u><i> GitHub</i></u></a>, although it can also be accessed online at

                    The Manchester digital twin project and the internship I did under the EPSRC vacation internship scheme hugely reaffirmed
                    my interest in further studying the combination of computer science and urban science at a PhD level. So, for my final
                    year project at Exeter, I decided I wanted to look at other elements of the field and research gerrymandering and the
                    ways machine learning can be used to draw electoral boundaries. All my main projects can be found in more detail <i><u><a href='projects.html'>here</a></u></i>.

                        In the summer of 2021, I helped with an ongoing project into nature-inspired approaches to electric vehicle transportation
                        under the EPSRC vacation internship scheme. The goal of the project was to use multi-objective optimisation techniques
                        to find the best way to completely transition Exeter’s bus network to use electric vehicles, with my part being to look
                        at how the model could be expanded. I was able to research a lot into the problem itself and learned a great deal about
                        public transportation planning and nature-inspired algorithms, as well as gain some valuable experience in PhD research.

                        I worked alongside the network manager of the school in upgrading and servicing all of their computers over the course of
                        the summer, as well as helping to fix any other technical issues that came up. This greatly helped my technical knowledge
                        of computer hardware, but I was also able to get a better understanding of how larger organisations function on a technical
                        level.

                        I took a large role in fixing and redesigning elements of the company’s website before the launch of a new service, as well as 
                        creating some additional branding to be used by other employees. I also created and sent out e-communications for various
                        clients, helping my ability to deliver the highest quality and service I could whilst following their specifications. Although
                        this also generally gave me a lot more confidence in my web development and graphic design skills.

                        Outside of my interests within Computer Science, I am also a fully qualified sailing instructor and have been helping to
                        run training at my local reservoir, and competing in national competitions, for many years. I also became the club’s junior
                        coordinator for some time, helping to organise extra social events for younger members as well as helping with some of
                        the administrative elements of training. This has all greatly helped my ability to adapt and plan under pressure, and I
                        continue to take part in the club when I am not at university.
